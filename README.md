## Installation
### Once the repos has been cloned run npm install in the terminal. I suggest adding your own .env file to the repos. After everything has been installed simply type node server.js and the application will run. It should be listening on localhost:8080.

## Usage
### When a user clicks on the application's link they will be sent to a page called Eat Da Burger. On this page there is a gif of a burger, a card that says 'Burgers to Eat Later', a card saying 'Devoured Burgers' and a submit input. A user will then type in a name of a burger. Once the submit button is clicked the burger submitted will appear to the left, under the Burgers to Eat Later. There will be two buttons next to the text, Devour and Delete Order. If the user chooses to devour the burger they simply click the button. The devoured burger will now appear on the right side of the page under Devoured Burgers. In this section the only choice for the user is to delete the order. The user can submit as many burgers as they would like and delete or devour them.
